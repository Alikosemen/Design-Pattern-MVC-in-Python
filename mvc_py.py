""""
Letâ€˜s consider a case of a test management system (TMS) that queries for a list of defects.
Here are two typical scenarios that work with any test management system.
* If the user queries for a particular defect, the test management system displays
the summary of the defect to the user in a prescribed format.
* If the user searches for a component it shows list of all defects logged against
that component.
